# Hudi Deltastreamer with Postgres + Debezium + EMR + PySpark + S3

The hardest part of getting real time data from databases to S3 is setting up Debezium correctly. So majority of this course will focus on setting up Debezium and then setting up the rest of the infrastructure to accommodate streaming. Even though this course is focused on streaming from Postgres, it can easily be adapted to any database connection supported by Debezium once set up.
